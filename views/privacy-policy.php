<p><strong>Website Visitors</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like most website operators, writing experts hub collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Book Writer’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Book Writer’s visitors use its website. From time to time, writing experts hub may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">writing experts hub also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on our blog or submitting a form. writing experts hub only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.</span></p>

In each case, writing experts hub collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Book. writing experts hub does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
